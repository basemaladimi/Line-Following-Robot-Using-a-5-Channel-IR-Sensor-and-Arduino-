# Line-Following-Robot-Using-a-5-Channel-IR-Sensor-and-Arduino-
In this project, we built a line-following robot using simple components like Arduino and  l298n motor driver. Our team developed the control algorithm, integrated the sensors, designed the circuit, assembled the hardware, and assisted in debugging and testing.
